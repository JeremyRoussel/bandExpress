    "description": "Seattle's Candlebox exploded out of the gate with their heavy-rocking 1993 self-titled debut. But don't call these guys grunge. Sure, frontman Kevin Martin contends with Eddie Vedder for the most aching warble on angsty power ballads like 'Far Behind' and 'Cover Me', but the band's most intense moments come when they straight up rock. The opening 'Don't You' chugs like early Aerosmith as Peter Klett works his guitar into a searing, squealing frenzy, while 'Rain' furiously transforms from a bluesy jam to a wild pop-metal blowout.",
